2. Open https://steamcommunity.com/saliengame/gettoken and save it as `token.txt` in same folder as `cheat.php`
3. Select PHP or Python version of the script, you don't need both

   2. Extract zip to `C:\php`
   3. Open `php.ini-production` in a text editor
   4. Find `;extension=curl` and remove the semicolon
